\[What is this book for\]

Part of it is motion in general...

-   @{sec-space-science}: Thinking about space, scientifically
    -   geospatial vs. human-spatial
    -   personal space findings
-   @{sec-space-math}: Thinking about space, mathematically

-   Tidy spatial data with `dddr`
    -   why a separate library
-   Key spatial operations

Part of it is a technical guide...

The process is (in order):

-   Understanding the .myrec file format
-   Understanding the BIDS format
-   Converting from .myrec to BIDS
-   Example analysis

## Motion Data Analysis

The best place to start is with tidy data. Tidy data, for an experiment, is best in the BIDS format. This format specifies a file name and folder structure convention in addition to existing data structures (tsv) so that the structure of the experiment (conditions, participants, time points) is explicitly modeled rather than implicit.

Data already in this format can be processed using [the `rbids` library](https://github.com/markromanmiller/rbids). Documentation is largely not present, unfortunately.

`rbids` is not specific to motion data, though, so working with motion data is done with the `dddr` library (see @sec-dddr). `dddr` has quite a few functions an decent documentation, but still has bugs.

Finally, built upon `rbids` is what is currently called [`synsyn` (for synchronizing on synchrony measurement)](https://github.com/markromanmiller/synsyn). This "package" is currently just two functions that aid in applying the same function to either each person's data ('summarize_motion') or pairs who attended the same session ('summarize_motion_pairs').
