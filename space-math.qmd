# Thinking about Space, Mathematically {#sec-space-math}

## Terminology

- acceleration
- velocity
- speed
- jerk 
  - snap, crackle, pop, etc.
  
- orientation (loops back)
- angular velocity (direction and magnitude)
- angular acceleration (direction and magnitude)

## Representing Position

- 3d Vector. Pretty straightforward.
- Know your coordinate basis.

## Representing Rotations

### Tait-Bryan (Euler) Angles

- Commonly used
- Technically called tait-bryan angles in most situations
- 

### Rotation Matrices

- nice when you don't have a lot of them lined up by time
- but they are pretty decent to train on (find that 6DOF paper)


### Quaternions
